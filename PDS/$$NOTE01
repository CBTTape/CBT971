Notes on EMPTYTST.

1.  The original version was modified by Gerhard Postpischil, who
    solved the problem of the S013-18 message appearing, when the
    pds member in SYSUT1 didn't exist.  Gerhard also made sure that
    EMPTYTST will run on MVS 3.8 as well, and he and the original
    author went back and forth fixing any remaining bugs, in
    collaboration.  We are hoping that this is a satisfactory and
    reliable product, but it is (of course) subject to all CBT Tape
    disclaimers, and you use it at your own risk.

2.  For archival purposes, we are preserving the original version of
    the EMPTYTST program source as member EMPTYT00.
