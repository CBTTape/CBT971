*    PURPOSE :  THIS PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO BE USED       *
*               IN A BATCH JOBSTREAM, TO DETERMINE IF ONE OF THE      *
*               JOB STEPS ACTUALLY WROTE DATA TO A FILE, OR IT        *
*               DIDN'T WRITE ANY DATA, AND THE FILE IS EMPTY.         *
*                                                                     *
*               AFTER THAT JOB STEP, YOU RUN AN "EMPTYTST" STEP,      *
*               WITH THE SYSUT1 DDNAME POINTING TO THE FILE TO BE     *
*               TESTED.  AND EMPTYTST DETERMINES IF THE FILE HAS      *
*               ANY DATA IN IT, OR NOT.                               *
*                                                                     *
*    RESTRICTIONS:  SYSUT1 CANNOT POINT TO A CONCATENATION OF         *
*               DATASETS.  SYSUT1 MUST POINT TO A SINGLE DATASET      *
*               OR A SINGLE PDS MEMBER.  IF SYSUT1 POINTS TO A        *
*               CONCATENATION OF DATASETS, THEN EMPTYTST RETURNS      *
*               A (SEVERE ERROR) CODE OF 16.                          *

*    This program was designed to be run in a jobstream, to           *
*    determine whether a dataset (usually one produced by the         *
*    jobstream) is empty or not, and to proceed according to          *
*    the result obtained.  This result may be reported in any         *
*    of three ways:                                                   *
*                                                                     *
*    1.  The return code:  0 for not-empty                            *
*                          4 for empty                                *
*                          8 for pds member does not exist            *

*    2.  SYSPRINT output:  This is a separate report, if that is      *
*                          desired.  The usefulness of this is        *
*                          determined by whomever designed the        *
*                          jobstream.                                 *
*                                                                     *
*        //SYSPRINT is an optional DD name.  If SYSPRINT is not       *
*                          coded in the JCL, then it will not         *
*                          be opened.  If it is coded, then           *
*                          PARM=Q can turn it off.  But PARM=W        *
*                          when coded with PARM=Q together,           *
*                          will still keep the WTO messages.          *
*                                                                     *
*    3.  A WTO message  :  If this program is being run as part       *
*                          of a big job, then usually one would       *
*                          want to test the system messages and       *
*                          make a judgment from there, as to how      *
*                          the job went.  Therefore WTO messages      *
*                          are supplied (using PARM=W), to report     *
*                          the result of running this program.        *

*    PARMS:  Parms which may be coded are either W, Q, or C.          *
*            If these letters occur in any order in the PARM          *
*            field, the corresponding parm will be switched on.       *

*            PARM=Q  :  Turns off SYSPRINT and will not even          *

*            PARM=C  :  When coded with W, only issues the            *
