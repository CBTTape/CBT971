//***FILE 971 is a batch program called EMPTYTST, which is          *   FILE 971
//*           designed to find out if a sequential dataset          *   FILE 971
//*           (DSORG=PS) or a PDS member is empty.  This may        *   FILE 971
//*           be needed for JCL jobstreams to find out the outcome  *   FILE 971
//*           of a job step (if it produced any data) and to        *   FILE 971
//*           then proceed with the jobstream, depending on the     *   FILE 971
//*           return code.                                          *   FILE 971

//*     Improvements to the original source of EMPTYTST, were       *   FILE 971
//*     made by Gerhard Postpischil, and bugs were corrected        *   FILE 971
//*     through the collaboration of Gerhard and the original       *   FILE 971
//*     author.                                                     *   FILE 971

//*     Enhanced the SYSPRINT report with job and time information  *   FILE 971
//*     that was already available in the JESMSGLG and JESYSMSG     *   FILE 971
//*     reports.  You might be following the progress of your       *   FILE 971
//*     jobs using the SYSPRINT reports only, so that information   *   FILE 971
